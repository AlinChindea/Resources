# Code Reading Club agenda

## Club goals and expectations (14:05) 
- Intro code reading club concept
- Intro people in the group including experience & types of programming
-- JS, python, done before, extent to which other people read code in the way that I do, from humanities background, words rather than structures
-- JS, php, bash, reading code is one of most importnt skills you can have as a programmer, most of our days spent writing and reading.
-- JS 4 years, no cs background, read similar on Dan Abrimov, reviewing and debugging
-- No tech education, humanities, not reading code as other people, dev ops not reading full time or as main activity but would like to, least experienced in group, reading documention, tutorial, not being able to tye everything together, and flow, being able to wrap my mind around it all and how the components fit together. Bash, python
-- CS bg. wroked in IT mich of adult life. bash, python, perl, bit JS. Reading more code than I write these days, not sure if I like that not. Better understanding of code I get exposed to. Read code blind sounded good to me.
- Set sessions. Frequency and length.
-- Discuss with Rupert not sure if 1 per week will be better to get it moving more quickly
- Discuss goals and expectations of group members
-- Done in intros

### Interaction with code (10 mins) (14:20)
1. Colour1 the variables - circle and draw links between instatiation and all uses
1. Colour2 the method/ function calls - circle and draw links between declarations and calls
1. Colour3 the classes - circle and draw links between classes and their instances

#### Discuss the results (10 mins) (14:30)
1. What patterns are visible from the colors and indentations only?
1. What parts of the code warrant more attention based on the colors and indentation?

-- Know nothing abour redux react, modern, funky js. Curious about the useDispath - can't figure out what it's doing.
-- Interested in import (5-10) reliying on prefix to determine what sort of thing it was
-- diff between var and function in react / js. doing word names vs.
-- Looks similar 
-- Asking what sort of tool for static typing were they using there are types written down all over the place.
-- consentrated on variables in the inside of the component itself
-- Took me a while, but interested in how the imports were effecting
-- What is this thing returning? And then work backwards
-- colouring starting from line 1 high density at the top. Not sure if that means it's more important or just where I started

### Content

#### Identify (10 mins) (14:40)
1. As a group breifly define what it means to be important and what constitues a line
1. Independently identify the 5 lines you consider most important

#### Discuss (10 mins)
Take turns in the group, and let every member talk about the code for 30 seconds (or less/more, could also be one sentence each). Try to add new information and not repeat things that have been said, and repeat until people do not know new things anymore.
[Save the last word for me protocol](https://lead.nwp.org/knowledgebase/save-the-last-word-for-me-protocol/)
Discuss in the group:
- lines covered by many people?
- lines named but not by a lot of people
- Agree less than 10 of the most important lines


#### Summarize in less than 10 sentences (10 mins)
1. Independently write down the essence of the code in a few sentences
1. Discuss in the group
- topics covered by many vs few
- strategies used to create the summary (e.g. method names, documentation, variable names, prior knowledge of system)
1. Create a summary together
1. Compare the summary with the available documentation (inside and outside the code)
- identify differences and similarities between the groups findings and the existing

## Wash up (5 mins)
- What worked well
- What worked badly
- Code snippet for next session? Bash? We forgot to talk about in Goals.

## Reminder to note for reflection next session
- Between sessions, note times when you notice that code reading club has helped you in your other projects or conversations.
