## Wash ups

### Worked well

- line numbers!
- the club and conversations
- This is a sufficiently sized example to have a crack at in the time we have
- Amazing that we had an interesting conversation about simpole bit of code
- Conversation is more about what it is doing and the structure rather than talking about the code syntax line by line (outputs/ comments/ it's messy/ it's noisy not this is a class and how we write it, etc.)
- python which is what I am learaning anyway
- good, clean piece of code, as every week we look at different code (language wise)
- seemingly simple lines of code but more challenging than thought
- reflection brought up quite a few uses about the information/techniques learned from previous sessions
- Interesting code choice, challenged more experienced developers!


### Worked badly

- ran out of time
- taking notes and facilitating at the same time
- experienced developers were doing most of the talking
- The second bit of code (test output) wasn't looked at
- Is as important and as hard to read as the comments
- We talked about the wrong part of the code, not the interesting part
- we didn't talk about method, class, variable this time
- Not prepared for today - in a sprint week
- didn't stick to the agenda and we tend to spend more time on certain parts (perhaps this tells us something about the group dynamic and maybe the agenda should be tailored to meet the group's needs?)
- for beginners, some technical chat between more experienced developers was confusing/difficult to follow especially when not indicating the number of the code line in reference
- time :-( we always overrun
- no printer! need to have a section on digital marking and colouring code
- prepare feedback comments before session we always struggle to remember
- different formats when printed, maybe provide code samples as pdf with line numbers
