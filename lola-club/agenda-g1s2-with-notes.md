# Code Reading Club agenda

## Reflections
- Mentioned to my partner (also a developer) & she thinks it's a great idea.
- I have to read and analyse 2 unfamiliar codebases in Java (not a language I use). I would have been apprehensive about this, but now I'm looking forward to it instead because of experience in code reading club. It'll be like a private code reading session.

### Interaction with code (10 mins) 14:08
#### Discuss the results (10 mins) 14:15
- I focused on finding things the things
- Noticed varibles used but not declared
- I had to re-map my idesa of what constitues and variable and a function
- I noted external programs (like `node`) and bash commands (like `test`) as functions
- Things seem to exist simply by referring to them. No imports.

Agreed - purpose was to run `VS Code` application with electron. The branching was necessary for compatibility and configs for iOS, linux and Linux in Windows. As a group, we belatedly noticed early return (line 35) because it was pointed out by 1 group memeber.


## Wash up (5 mins)
- Adds excitement to read something in a language I'm not familiar with
- There were no philosophical conversations around what constitutes important, maybe due to language or nature of the code in execution
- Looking at code different languages makes me question my mental model of what code really is and how it interacts with the machine (what really is the difference between a command and a function). No matter how we imagine it, it boils down to instructions for the hardware.
