# Code Reading Club agenda

## Club goals and expectations

Motivations
* atttracted by fun, learning GQL
* interested and curious recent tangles with legacy
* curious problem solving
* it all life, not engaged with code
* had touble reading someone else's code
* make the bridge to a humanities-style reading approach

Wished-for Gains
- encounter new languages
- improve skills at reading code
- engaging with software from a non-project persepctive


### Interaction with code (10 mins)


* comforting to draw the connections
* interesting to see the imports being used
* the use of imports led me to an important line
Some participants were drawn directly into a consideration of the code's functioning.
Discussing the shapes in abstract was not easy. Perhaps harder because we lacked visual reference.

### Content

#### Identify (10 mins)
* importance is not crashing
* importance is the core funtions

#### Discuss (10 mins)
Take turns in the group, and let every member talk about the code for 30 seconds (or less/more, could also be one sentence each). Try to add new information and not repeat things that have been said, and repeat until people do not know new things anymore.
[Save the last word for me protocol](https://lead.nwp.org/knowledgebase/save-the-last-word-for-me-protocol/)
1. Discuss in the group:
- lines covered by many people?
- lines named but not by a lot of people
- Agree less than 10 of the most important lines

Discussion around outliers was especially productive

#### Summarize in less than 10 sentences (10 mins)
We didn't get this far...

## Wash up (5 mins)
- What worked well
- What worked badly

* the code was blurry at the start later it was clear
* taking time and identifying was different from my normal approach to open a new file
* interesting to see how different perspectives on importance
* seeing similar apporaches to problems we face

- it might be nice to see the code in advance for some

## Reminder to note for reflection next session
- Between sessions, note times when you notice that code reading club has helped you in your other projects or conversations.
