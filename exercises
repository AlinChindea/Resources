This page contains a set of exercises which can be used in Code Reading Clubs. Of course, your club does not need to use all exercises, they are meant as a starting point. If you are trying out variants, do let us know!
For now we have divided them into basic and advanced. Advanced exercises can be used in clube that have been running for a while, or when doing a second seccion on the same code snippet.

## Basic Exercises

### Code structure

You will need:
- two printed copies of the code for today's club
- some graph paper 
- or coloured paper and scissors 
- or acetate and something to write on it with
- coloured pens, crayons or pencils

#### Examine structure (10 mins)
The goal of this exercise is to be a concrete thing to *do* when looking at new code for the first time.

Color variables
* Go through the code and circle all variables in red
* Then draw a link between variables and their uses

Color method/function calls
* Go through the code and circle all methods in blue 
* Then draw a link between methods and their invocations

Instantiation 
* Go through the code and circle all instances of classes in green 
* Then draw a link between classes and their instances

#### Discuss the results (10 mins)
1. What patterns are visible from the colors and links only?
1. What parts of the code warrant more attention based on the colors?

### Content

#### Identify most important lines (10 mins)
1. Define what it means to be important and independently identify the 5 lines you consider most important

#### Discussion (10 mins)
1. Discuss in the group:
- lines covered by many people?
- lines named but not by a lot of people
- Agree less than 10 of the most important lines

Take turns in the group, and let every member talk about the code for 30 seconds (or less/more, could also be one sentence each). Try to add new information and not repeat things that have been said, and repeat until people do not know new things anymore.

#### Summarize in less than 10 sentences individually (10 mins)
1. Independently write down the essence of the code in a few sentences

#### Discussion (10 mins)
- topics covered by many vs few
- strategies used to create the summary (e.g. method names, documentation, variable names, prior knowledge of system)

#### Summarize in less than 10 sentences (10 mins)
1. Create a summary together
1. Compare the summary with the available documentation (inside and outside the code)
- identify differences and similarities between the groups findings and the existing
