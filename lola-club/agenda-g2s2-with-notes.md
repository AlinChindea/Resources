# Code Reading Club agenda

## Reminder to note for reflection next session
- Between sessions, note times when you notice that code reading club has helped you in your other projects or conversations.

* Some folk report it is making them reflect consciously when reading code
* One had tried marking up, when reading a difficult piece. Not sure it helped
* Others simply that they enjoyed the first session and were looking forward to another

### Interaction with code

* in this case the locus is in the centre
* indentation supports this
* as does the upflow from the hoisted private functions

### Content

#### Identify (10 mins)

* We talked about trying to to this with blocks not loc, but it seemed to be cheating in the end

#### Discuss (10 mins)


#### Summarize in less than 10 sentences (10 mins)
Interesting and lengthy discussion in which we discovered that we were still split about the core purpose of the code. We had become enmeshed in some of the edge cases, and had mostly ignored a main case.

## Wash up (5 mins)
- What worked well
- What worked badly
