# Code Reading Club agenda

## Club goals and expectations

* need to read different languages - already has an idea for us to read some C# - general knowlege about programming
* get comfortable reading someone else's code - understand faster - exposure to concepts - diminish fear
* reading code makes you better - make one's mind more flexible
* didn't learn many languiages in school - interested to find if I can understand code in an unfamiliar language - how can I apply my general knowlege - gain a view of other languages to explore possible change
* curiosity - compare a book club with a code club - see pateterns and particularites
* like a puzzle game - fun - understand other patterns

### Interaction with code

* i didn't start from the top and missed stuff - I use phpstorm for this normally - it is harder on paper
* it feels necessary to tread from top to bottom
* declaration then use - inline definitions buck the trend
* I tried to be the interpreter/compiler
* I threaded the word patients through the code

### Content

#### Identify (10 mins)
1. As a group breifly define what it means to be important and what constitues a line
1. Independently identify the 5 lines you consider most important

* inverse importance - what can you take out
* locus - many things pointing to it
* correctness - will it break
* function - relies on an understanding of the purpose of the code

#### Discuss (10 mins)


## Wash up (5 mins)
* even if excerscises don't "work" for everyone they all have value because they articulate different approaches
