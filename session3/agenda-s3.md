# Code Reading Club agenda
katja, charlie, alin, amanda, nick, rob

## Reflection (5 mins) 12:37
- Note a time the past 2 weeks when you used one of the techniques from the club in your work
- Note a time the past 2 weeks when you used information learned about code in your work
Telling people it is amazing
Not actual evidence of how it helps but - observations
Beginner things more about features and less about keywords whereas I think about keywords, not what they are doing. Makes me think about comments more.
Crazy that we used to learn by reading lines
Increased my confidence of reading python (beginner) - not just learning concepts only.
Here to see if there is anything I'm missing -some of the techniques second nature
In terms of teaching me how to code. I don't follow instructions.

## Exercises
At the start everyone should look at the same code, but as the club evolves you can tackle a bigger bit of code by splitting into sections. These exercises are best carried out when the code can fit on one or two pages but with it being the norm to split in many ways - we hope to invent and discover different exercises.

You will need:
- two printed copies of the code for today's club
- some graph paper - or coloured paper and scissors - or acetate and something to write on it with
- coloured pens, crayons or pencils

### Interaction with code (10 mins) 12:42
1. Colour1 the variables - circle and draw links between instatiation and all uses
1. Colour2 the method/ function calls - circle and draw links between declarations and calls
1. Colour3 the classes - circle and draw links between classes and their instances
1. Draw the indentaiton patterns - There are a few ways to do this. Fill over with black sharpie. Trace on graph paper. Trace on acetate. etc?

#### Discuss the results (10 mins) 12:52
1. What patterns are visible from the colors and indentations only?
1. What parts of the code warrant more attention based on the colors and indentation?

- Identation shows that import inside of the function. I'm used to languages where imports happen at top of file.
- Import works wherever you use it in python. Like require in js.
- Indentation level scopes stuff the block of code
- Comment very noisy compared to the code
- Looks like it's inside a REPL
- Doc test library needs the syntax for parsing
- Confused me at first - thought it was the code

### Content

#### Identify (10 mins) 13:00
1. Define what it means to be important and independently identify the 3 lines you consider most important
1. Discuss in the group:
- lines covered by many people?
46 (4 people) and 47 (3 people)
- lines named but not by a lot of people
10, 37, 48, 49 (2 people) and 52,53 (1 person)
- Agree less than 7 of the most important lines
- 46, 47, 38, 40, 42 - interestingly when we only had 3 lines to choose independently, no one chose 38,40,42

#### Discuss (10 mins) 13:20
Take turns in the group, and let every member talk about the code for 30 seconds (or less/more, could also be one sentence each). Try to add new information and not repeat things that have been said, and repeat until people do not know new things anymore.
[Save the last word for me protocol](https://lead.nwp.org/knowledgebase/save-the-last-word-for-me-protocol/)

- Form is confusing because I don't know python
- I'm a beginner and it doesn't match what I know about python. Is a mess.
- If it didn't have the if block for floats, would not need to import all of `math`
- I like lots of code examples in file don't always see that
- Big numbers in python 300 zeros behind one number
- Python is lovely for big numbers
- You can have too much tests in your comments
-Impression that formatting of comments is not consistant with the """ on same line at start and new line at end.
- There's only one inline comment (catch the big number by using n+1 ==n)
- Now I understand why we have colour coding in our IDEs

#### Summarize in less than 10 sentences (10 mins) SKIPPED
1. Independently write down the essence of the code in a few sentences
1. Discuss in the group
- topics covered by many vs few
- strategies used to create the summary (e.g. method names, documentation, variable names, prior knowledge of system)
1. Create a summary together
1. Compare the summary with the available documentation (inside and outside the code)
- identify differences and similarities between the groups findings and the existing


## Wash up (5 mins) 13:27
### What worked well
- This is a sufficiently sized example to have a crack at in the time we have
- Amazing that we had an interesting conversation about simpole bit of code
- Conversation is more about what it is doing and the structure rather than talking about the code syntax line by line (outputs/ comments/ it's messy/ it's noisy not this is a class and how we write it, etc.)
- python which is what I am learaning anyway

### What worked badly
- The second bit of code (test output) wasn't looked at
- Is as important and as hard to read as the comments
- We talked about the wrong part of the code, not the interesting part
- we didn't talk about method, class, variable this time
- Not prepared for today - in a sprint week

Finish 13:35

## Follow up (2 weeks of elapsed time)
- Identify code for next session, keeping in mind Wash up and Reflection information
