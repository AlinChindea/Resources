# Code reading club

This is an experiment inspired by the research and teaching excercises designed by Felienne Hermans. At its core is the idea that the paradigm we use to teach programming is flawed. One of the most obvious ommissions is the ability to read code, bth phoneticlly and analytically. We aren't suitably equiping ourselves with these building blocks.

## The Plan
We run the club initially for 6-8 weeks. Hopefully we find it so useful that we don't want to stop. We meet for 1 hour every other week. Sometimes there is optional prep in the form of reading, that participants can choose to do as homework outside that time.

## The Collaboration
Neontribe run the club and feed back to Felienne on a regular basis about what works and what doesn't. She comes up with potential exercises. We come up with potential exercises. We experiment and try to make the sessions useful and enlightening.

## The Expectation
Participants should have some professional coding experience. Apart from that, the sessions should work for a diverse group (in terms of cognitive, formal training, experience, skills, style etc). The sessions use a variety of languages and styles of code. The key benefit should be increased ability to understand code when reading and a more sympathetic style of writing code to be read by others.

## The Stuff
The directories in this repo contain the resources and wash-up notes from each session.
